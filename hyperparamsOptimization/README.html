<h1>Hyperparameter Tuning</h1>

<p>The creation, engineering and preprocessing of  statistical features, the selection of the suitable ones and finally the parametrization of the algorithm are
the main domains, where a user typically adjusts a machine learning system in order to make it succesful. <br />
It therefore makes sense to search for optimal values automatically. This is often referred to as "hyperparameter tuning". </p>

<p>The standard approaches that have been around for a long time are a brute force approach doing grid search over the parameter space.
This has been reported to be inferior to a random search strategy in the paper by Bergstra et al.. 
Often approaches are based on Bayesian Optimization in order to arrive at good parameter setting more quickly.
Kanter et. al seem to an exception and use Gaussian Copula Process (GCP) instead.</p>

<p>There exist various packages for this optimization.</p>

<p>"Gaussian process Bayesian optimization, optimizing the hyperparameters of a squared-exponential covariance, and proposed the Tree Parzen Algorithm." [Snoeak et. al.]</p>

<ul>
<li>Most packages seem to use Bayesian Optimization / Gaussian Processes approach to model the relationship f between parameter choices and the performance of the whole system
Most use  (who)</li>
<li>Kanter et. al seem to an exception and use Gaussian Copula Process (GCP) instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the notable packages that we know of</p>

<p>The performance of machine learning systems depends on its parameter settings. Therefore it is , especially if thereâ€™s more than one or two hyperparameters</p>

<p>(b) autotune a machine learning pathway to extract the most value out of the synthesized features</p>
